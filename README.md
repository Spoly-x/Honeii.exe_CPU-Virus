## Results

### CPU Overload:
The code constantly runs the processor at close to 100% through complex operations (factorial programming) in an endless loop.

This can cause the processor to overheat and damage other components of the computer.

### System Instability:
Excessive CPU usage can cause system crashes and the computer to become temporarily unresponsive or freeze.
Active programs and the persistence system can be affected.
### Hardware Damage:
Especially on laptops, processor temperatures can reach dangerous levels due to inadequate cooling systems.
Prolonged overheating can shorten the life of the processor and other hardware components or cause permanent damage.
### Battery Drain:
On laptops, such a processor load causes the battery to cool down too quickly.
### Data Loss:
System corruption, such as freezing or crashing, is possible, and unsaved data can be lost.
